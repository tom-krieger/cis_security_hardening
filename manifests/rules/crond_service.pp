# @summary 
#    Ensure cron daemon is enabled and running 
#
# The cron daemon is used to execute batch jobs on the system.
#
# Rationale:
# While there may not be user jobs that need to be run on the system, the system does have 
# maintenance jobs that may include security monitoring that have to run. If another method 
# for scheduling tasks is not being used, cron is used to execute them, and needs to be enabled 
# and running.
#
# @param enforce
#    Enforce the rule
#
# @param uninstall_cron
#    uninstall cron from the system
#
# @example
#   class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::crond_service':
#       enforce => true,
#       uninstall_cron => false
#   }
#
# @api public
