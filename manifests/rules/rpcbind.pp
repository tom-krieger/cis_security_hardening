# @summary 
#    Ensure rpcbind is not installed or the rpcbind services are masked 
#
# The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind 
# when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to 
# serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The 
# rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested 
# service.
#
# Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC 
# services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. 
# When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where 
# the RPC server is listening.
#
# Rationale:
# A small request (~82 bytes via UDP) sent to the Portmapper generates a large response (7x to 28x amplification), 
# which makes it a suitable tool for DDoS attacks. If rpcbind is not required, it is recommended that the rpcbind 
# package be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system.
# 
# Note: many of the libvirt packages used by Enterprise Linux virtualization, and the nfs-utils package used for 
# The Network File System (NFS) are dependent on the rpcbind package. If the rpcbind is required as a dependency, 
# the services rpcbind.service and rpcbind.socket should be stopped and masked to reduce the attack surface of 
# the system.
