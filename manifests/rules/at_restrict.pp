# @summary 
#    Ensure at is restricted to authorized users 
#
# If at is installed in the system, configure /etc/at.allow to allow specific users to use 
# these services. If /etc/at.allow does not exist, then /etc/at.deny is checked. Any user 
# not specifically defined in those files is allowed to use at. By removing the file, only 
# users in /etc/at.allow are allowed to use at.
#
# Note: Even though a given user is not listed in at.allow, at jobs can still be run as that user. 
# The at.allow file only controls administrative access to the at command for scheduling and 
# modifying at jobs.
#
# Rationale:
# On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule at jobs. Using the 
# at.allow file to control who can run at jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage an 
# allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system 
# and forget to add it to the deny files.
#
# @param enforce
#    Enforce the rule
#
# @example
#   class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::at_restrict':
#       enforce => true,
#   }
#
# @api public
class cis_security_hardening::rules::at_restrict (
  Boolean $enforce = false,
) {
  if $enforce {
    file { '/etc/at.allow':
      ensure => file,
      owner  => 'root',
      group  => 'root',
      mode   => '0600',
    }

    file { '/etc/at.deny':
      ensure => absent,
    }
  }
}
