# @summary 
#    Ensure events that modify user/group information are collected 
#
# Record events affecting the group , passwd (user IDs), shadow and gshadow (passwords) or /etc/security/opasswd 
# (old passwords, based on remember parameter in the PAM configuration) files. The parameters in this section 
# will watch the files to see if they have been opened for write or have had attribute changes (e.g. permissions) 
# and tag them with the identifier "identity" in the audit log file.
#
# Rationale:
# Unexpected changes to these files could be an indication that the system has been compromised and that an 
# unauthorized user is attempting to hide their activities or compromise additional accounts.
#
# @param enforce
#    Sets rule enforcement. If set to true, code will be exeuted to bring the system into a comliant state.
#
# @example
#   class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::auditd_identity':
#             enforce => true,
#   }
#
# @api public
class cis_security_hardening::rules::auditd_identity (
