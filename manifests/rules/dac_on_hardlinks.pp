# @summary
#    Ensure the operating system is configured to enable DAC on hardlinks
#
# The operating system must enable kernel parameters to enforce discretionary access control on hardlinks.
#
# Rationale:
# Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects 
# and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., 
# read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified 
# ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An 
# example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.
#
# When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to 
# what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects 
# that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the 
# discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its 
# operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints 
# of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing 
# information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject 
# to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information 
# system boundary. Once the information is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means 
# may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of 
# discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this 
# use of discretionary access control.
#
# By enabling the fs.protected_hardlinks kernel parameter, users can no longer create soft or hard links to files 
# they do not own. Disallowing such hardlinks mitigate vulnerabilities based on insecure file system accessed by 
# privileged programs, avoiding an exploitation vector exploiting unsafe use of open() or creat().
#
# Satisfies: SRG-OS-000312-GPOS-00122, SRG-OS-000312-GPOS-00123, SRG-OS-000312- GPOS-00124, SRG-OS-000324-GPOS-00125

# @param enforce
#    Enforce the rule.
#
# @example
#   include cis_security_hardening::rules::dac_on_hardlinks
class cis_security_hardening::rules::dac_on_hardlinks (
  Boolean $enforce = false
) {
  if $enforce {
    Sysctl {
      'fs.protected_hardlinks':
        value  => 1,
        notify => Exec['reload-sysctl-system'],
    }
  }
}
