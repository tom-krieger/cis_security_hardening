# @summary 
#    Ensure unnecessary services and ports are not accepted 
#
# Services and ports can be accepted or explicitly rejected or dropped by a zone.
#
# For every zone, you can set a default behavior that handles incoming traffic that is not further specified. 
# Such behavior is defined by setting the target of the zone. There are three options - default, ACCEPT, 
# REJECT, and DROP.
#
# * ACCEPT - you accept all incoming packets except those disabled by a specific rule.
# * REJECT - you disable all incoming packets except those that you have allowed in
#   specific rules and the source machine is informed about the rejection.
# * DROP - you disable all incoming packets except those that you have allowed in
# specific rules and no information sent to the source machine.
#
# Rationale:
# To reduce the attack surface of a system, all services and ports should be blocked unless required
#
# @param enforce
#    Enforce the rule
#
# @param expected_services
#    services to be configured in firewalld
#
# @param expected_ports
#    POrts to be configured in firewalld
#
# @example
#   class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::firewalld_ports_services':
#       enforce => true,
#       expected_services => ['ssh'],
#       expected_ports => ['25/tcp'],
#   }
