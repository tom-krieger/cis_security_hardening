# @summary 
#    Ensure only strong Key Exchange algorithms are used 
#
# Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between two parties, allowing 
# use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender and receiver wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be 
# equipped to encrypt messages to be sent and decrypt messages received
#
# Rationale:
# Key exchange methods that are considered weak should be removed. A key exchange method may be weak because too few 
# bits are used, or the hashing algorithm is considered too weak. Using weak algorithms could expose connections to 
# man-in-the-middle attacks.
#
# @param enforce
#    Enforce the rule 
#
# @param kexs 
#    Key exchange methods to add to config
#
# @example
#   class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::sshd_kex':
#       enforce => true,
#       kexs => ['a','b'],
#   }
