# @summary 
#    Ensure SSH access is limited 
#
# There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is recommended that at least 
# one of the following options be leveraged:
#
# AllowUsers
# The AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific users to ssh into the system. The list 
# consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants 
# to restrict user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry can be specified 
# in the form of user@host. 
#
# AllowGroups
# The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. 
# The list consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable. 
#
# DenyUsers
# The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to ssh into the system. The list 
# consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants 
# to restrict user access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry can be specified in 
# the form of user@host. 
#
# DenyGroups
# The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific groups of users to ssh into the system. 
# The list consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.
#
# Rationale:
# Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only authorized users access the system.
