# @summary 
#    Ensure broadcast ICMP requests are ignored 
#
# Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system to ignore all ICMP echo 
# and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses.
#
# Rationale:
# Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for your 
# network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf attack. A Smurf 
# attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed source 
# address. All hosts receiving this message and responding would send echo-reply messages back to the 
# spoofed address, which is probably not routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of 
# traffic on the network could be significantly multiplied.
#
# @param enforce
#    Enforce the rule
#
# @example
#   class cis_security_hardening::rules::ignore_icmp_broadcast {
#       enforce => true,
#   }
#
# @api private
class cis_security_hardening::rules::ignore_icmp_broadcast (
  Boolean $enforce = false,
) {
  if $enforce {
    Sysctl {
      'net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts':
        value => 1,
    }
  }
}
