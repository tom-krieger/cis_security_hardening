# @summary 
#    Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled 
#
# SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, 
# or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, 
# and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network 
# from their home machines
#
# Rationale:
# Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors.
# SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed 
#network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if 
# it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to 
# hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network
#
# @param enforce
#    Enforce the rule 
#
# @example
#   class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::sshd_tcp_forwarding':
#       enforce => true,
#   }
#
# @api private
class cis_security_hardening::rules::sshd_tcp_forwarding (
