# @summary 
#    Ensure permissions on /etc/shadow- are configured 
#
# The /etc/shadow- file is used to store backup information about user accounts that is critical to the security 
# of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security information.
#
# Rationale:
# It is critical to ensure that the /etc/shadow- file is protected from unauthorized access. Although it is 
# protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either inadvertently or through malicious actions.
#
# @param enforce
#    Enforce the rule
#
# @example
#   class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::shadow_bak_perms':
#       enforce => true,
#   }
#
# @api private
class cis_security_hardening::rules::shadow_bak_perms (
  Boolean $enforce = false,
) {

      }
