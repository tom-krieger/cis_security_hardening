## Release 0.7.0

> This release contains some breaking changes to how `authselect` is configured. Please check your configuration and test before using in production environments.

Please review the following changes before updating to this version module:

* This release changes the authselect compliance rules. If you use Rocky Linux 8 or Alma Linux 8 please change your Hiera configuration. All `authselect` related stuff is consolidated into one rule file. This makes a change in your Hiera configuration necessary. The old configuration looks like this:

  ```hiera
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect_profile::enforce: true
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect_profile::custom_profile: cis
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect_profile::base_profile: minimal
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect_profile_select::enforce: true
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect_profile_select::custom_profile: cis
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect_profile_select::profile_options:
    - with-faillock
    - without-nullok
    - with-sudo
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect_with_faillock::enforce: true
  ```

  This should be changed into this configuration:

  ```hiera
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect::enforce: true
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect::custom_profile: cis
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect::base_profile: sssd
  cis_security_hardening::rules::authselect::profile_options:
    - with-faillock
    - without-nullok
    - with-sudo
  ```

* This release introduces a fact containing all available features for the slected `authselect` profile. nIf you add a profile option not available a waring message is printed and the configured option will be ignored.

* The PAM configuration rules have been changed to work with `authselect`.

## Release 0.6.2
