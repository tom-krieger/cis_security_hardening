## Classes

### <a name="cis_security_hardening"></a>`cis_security_hardening`

Define a complete security baseline and monitor the rules. The definition of the baseline can be done in Hiera.
The purpose of the module is to give the ability to setup complete security baseline which not necessarily have to stick
to an industry security guide like the CIS benchmarks.

The easiest way to use the module is to put all rule data into a hiera file. For more information please coinsult the README file.

          enforce => true,
}
```

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `cis_security_hardening::rules::automatic_error_reporting` class:

* [`enforce`](#-cis_security_hardening--rules--automatic_error_reporting--enforce)
* [`delete_package`](#-cis_security_hardening--rules--automatic_error_reporting--delete_package)

##### <a name="-cis_security_hardening--rules--automatic_error_reporting--enforce"></a>`enforce`

Data type: `Boolean`

Sets rule enforcemt. If set to true, code will be exeuted to bring the system into a comliant state.

Default value: `false`

### <a name="cis_security_hardening--rules--dac_on_hardlinks"></a>`cis_security_hardening::rules::dac_on_hardlinks`

The operating system must enable kernel parameters to enforce discretionary access control on hardlinks.

Rationale:
Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects
and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g.,
read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified
ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An
example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to
what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects
that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the
discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its
operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints
of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing
information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject
to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information
system boundary. Once the information is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means
may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of
discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this
use of discretionary access control.

By enabling the fs.protected_hardlinks kernel parameter, users can no longer create soft or hard links to files
they do not own. Disallowing such hardlinks mitigate vulnerabilities based on insecure file system accessed by
privileged programs, avoiding an exploitation vector exploiting unsafe use of open() or creat().

Default value: `false`

### <a name="cis_security_hardening--rules--dac_on_symlinks"></a>`cis_security_hardening::rules::dac_on_symlinks`

The operating system must enable kernel parameters to enforce discretionary access control on symlinks.

Rationale:
Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have
discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually
acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who
will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can

the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional
definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of
discretionary access control.

By enabling the fs.protected_symlinks kernel parameter, symbolic links are permitted to be followed only when outside a sticky
world-writable directory, or when the UID of the link and follower match, or when the directory owner matches the symlink's owner.

Disallowing such symlinks helps mitigate vulnerabilities based on insecure file system accessed by privileged programs, avoiding an
exploitation vector exploiting unsafe use of open() or creat().

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000312-GPOS-00122, SRG-OS-000312-GPOS-00123, SRG-OS-000312- GPOS-00124, SRG-OS-000324-GPOS-00125

#### Examples

class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::dac_on_symlinks':
  enforce => true,
}

* [`enforce`](#-cis_security_hardening--rules--dac_on_symlinks--enforce)

Default value: `false`

### <a name="cis_security_hardening--rules--gdm_lock_delay"></a>`cis_security_hardening::rules::gdm_lock_delay`

The operating system must prevent a user from overriding the screensaver lock-delay setting for the graphical user interface.

Rationale:
A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity
of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user
to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify
when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled.

#### Examples

##### 

```puppet
include cis_security_hardening::rules::gdm_lock_delay
```

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `cis_security_hardening::rules::gdm_lock_delay` class:
