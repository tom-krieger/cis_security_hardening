## Classes

### <a name="cis_security_hardening"></a>`cis_security_hardening`

Define a complete security baseline and monitor the rules. The definition of the baseline can be done in Hiera.
The purpose of the module is to give the ability to setup complete security baseline which not necessarily have to stick
to an industry security guide like the CIS benchmarks.

The easiest way to use the module is to put all rule data into a hiera file. For more information please coinsult the README file.

The operating system must be configured so that audit log files are not read or write- accessible by unauthorized users.

The operating system must be configured to permit only authorized users ownership of the audit log files.

The operating system must permit only authorized groups ownership of the audit log files.

Rationale:
Unauthorized disclosure of audit records can reveal system and configuration data to attackers, thus compromising its confidentiality.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, audit reports) needed to successfully audit
operating system activity.

#### Examples

##### 

```puppet
class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::auditd_log_perms':

### <a name="cis_security_hardeningrulesauditd_privileged_priv_change"></a>`cis_security_hardening::rules::auditd_privileged_priv_change`

The operating system must generate audit records for successful/unsuccessful uses of the su command.

Rationale:
Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization,
it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

@ api private

#### Examples

##### 

```puppet
class 8 'cis_security_hardening::rules::auditd_privileged_priv_change':
  enforce => true,
}
```

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `cis_security_hardening::rules::auditd_privileged_priv_change` class:

* [`enforce`](#enforce)

##### <a name="enforce"></a>`enforce`

Data type: `Boolean`

Enforce the rule

Default value: ``false``

### <a name="cis_security_hardeningrulesauditd_sudo_use"></a>`cis_security_hardening::rules::auditd_sudo_use`

The operating system must generate audit records for successful/unsuccessful uses of the sudo command.

Rationale:
Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would
be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible
for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

#### Examples

##### 

```puppet
class { 'cis_security_hardening::rules::auditd_sudo_use':
  enforce => true,
}
```

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `cis_security_hardening::rules::auditd_sudo_use` class:

* [`enforce`](#enforce)

##### <a name="enforce"></a>`enforce`

Data type: `Boolean`

Default value: ``false``

### <a name="cis_security_hardeningrulesmfetp"></a>`cis_security_hardening::rules::mfetp`

The operating system must deploy Endpoint Security for Linux Threat Prevention (ENSLTP).

Rationale:
Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous and/or periodic basis, the
operating system or other system components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software
flaws.

To support this requirement, the operating system may have an integrated solution incorporating continuous scanning
using HBSS and periodic scanning using other tools, as specified in the requirement.
